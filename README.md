The home page will provide the opening information and sale pitches. With whom they are partnerd with. 

The Special Offers and Other Offers will be layed out much like a blog and profile components. Images with brief discriptions on the side to indicate what offers they have to provide. If any of these items are clicked, they will open up with a bigger image (or images) with a ferther indepth discription of their offers they provide. 

The Contact page will have all the contact and location information with a email form that will send out any futher questions or concerns a future client may have. 

All four of these pages have a navigation bar for easy navigation between these pages and a footer with social connections information.
